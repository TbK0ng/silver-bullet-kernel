# Workflow Constitution

## Purpose

Define non-negotiable engineering rules for this workflow project.

## Constitutional Rules

1. Artifacts over chat memory

- Change intent, decisions, tasks, and verification evidence must live in repository files.

2. Verification over declaration

- No task is complete until verify gates pass.

3. One source of truth per concern

- Trellis guides own execution policy.
- OpenSpec artifacts own change lifecycle and requirements.

4. Parallel safety first

- One active change has one owner.
- Shared canonical specs are merged through archive flow.

5. Recoverability by default

- Session learnings are recorded and discoverable.
- Failure context is preserved for future sessions.

6. Measurability

- Weekly metrics must be generated from actual run data.
- Process changes are driven by observed failure and throughput trends.
